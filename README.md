# Project: Rock Paper Scissors

Live demo: [here](https://gregWDumont.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)!

This project represents one of my earliest experiences in development, where I created a simple implementation of a Rock Paper Scissors game. It was completed as part of my participation in The Odin Project's "foundation" [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

Through this project, I learned to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together, along with implementing game rules and fixing bugs.

While the implementation may seem naive today, it serves as a valuable reminder of my journey and growth as a developer.
