#Project: Rock Paper Scissors

Simple implementation of Rock Paper Scissors game from The Odin Project 'foundation' [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

Live demo : [here](https://gregWDumont.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)!

I have learned to use html, css, and javscript together as well as implementing game rules and fixing bugs.
